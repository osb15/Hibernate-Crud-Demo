# 📚 Hibernate CRUD Operations

A simple repository demonstrating **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using **Hibernate** with `CriteriaBuilder` and `CriteriaQuery`. This code serves as a basic example for beginners who want to understand how to integrate Hibernate for database operations in Java. 

---

## 🚀 Features
- Insert new student records into the database.  
- Update existing student records seamlessly.  
- Delete student records with a single operation.  
- Fetch and display all student records using Hibernate's Criteria API.  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+**  
- **Hibernate 5+**  
- **MySQL or any RDBMS** for the database.  
- **Eclipse IDE** (or any IDE of your choice).  
- Maven for dependency management.

---

## 🗂 Folder Structure
- **`com.Controller`**: Contains the controller to handle user inputs via the console.  
- **`com.Services`**: Contains service methods that call the DAO layer.  
- **`com.Dao`**: Responsible for interacting with the database via Hibernate.  
- **`com.entity`**: Contains the entity class annotated with Hibernate annotations.

## 📋 Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Configure your database connection in the Hibernate `hibernate.cfg.xml` file.
3. Run the `Student_Controller` class to interact with the system.
